# Uber-Trip-Analysis and Visualization

This Python script performs an analysis and visualization of Uber ride data. It includes steps to explore the dataset, perform K-means clustering on ride locations, and visualize ride patterns. The script also compares ride counts on weekdays vs. weekends.

Here we will execute the following steps:

- Load the Uber ride dataset.
- Explore dataset properties.
- Extract date, hour, and weekday information.
- Perform K-means clustering on ride locations to identify clusters.
- Visualize clustered taxi trip locations.
- Compare ride counts on weekdays vs. weekends.
- Create a scatter plot of the geographical data.

The generated visualizations will be displayed or saved as needed.

### Code Overview
Data Reading and Preprocessing: The code reads the Uber ride dataset from a CSV file, changes the "Date/Time" column to a datetime data type, and extracts additional features such as day, hour, and weekday.

### Clustering
It uses K-means clustering to group similar trip locations together. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method.

### Visualization
The code visualizes the clustered taxi trip locations on a scatter plot and compares Uber ride counts by both the day of the week and the hour of the day.

### Location Data Analysis
The code includes additional visualizations of location data points and clusters.

### Results
The code provides insights into Uber ride patterns, identifies areas with similar ride demand patterns, and helps visualize ride counts by different factors such as time of day and day of the week.
